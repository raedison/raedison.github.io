```{r}
library(reticulate)
py_install("numpy")
```
To best explain the way that python and R work hand-in-hand, I've created this simple example below that explains the usefulness of "reticulate" when troubleshooting. 

I used the numpy package in python to create two variables, x and y. They are 100 values pulled from a random normal sample of with a mean of  5 and a standard deviation of 1. When I tried to make a scatter plot, however, I ran into a set of error messages with python that I didn't know how to fix. I tried multiple help sites, but wasn't able to find a solution that I understood.
```{python}
import numpy as np
x=np.random.normal(5,1,100)
y=np.random.normal(5,1,100)
```

Thankfully, thanks to the "reticulate" function in R, I could easily just make my plot in R! I easily used ggplot in R to create a scatter plot of their interaction. It was really handy to be able make the variables in one language and still be able to use them when writing in another. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(py$x,py$y))+xlab("Python Variable X")+ylab("Python Variable Y")+ggtitle("Scatterplot of X vs. Y")
```
